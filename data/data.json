Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!", "I've been an android user all my life until I decided to try iPhone XR for iOS. Loving the camera and battery life is an absolute joy to have. It's been more than one month since I got this phone and I'm loving it. Face ID works flawlessly even in the dark and the dual sim function is working like a charm, I'm using Vodafone as my primary sim and Jio as e-sim and have faced no problem whatsoever.", "The camera is better compared to my previous android phone. The camera support \"live photo\" which I disabled it because I'm not used to it. It supports video recording at 4K 60 FPS. The camera also supports panorama mode which gives amazing results. Selfie is also good and the screen light up as flashlight when taking a selfie in the dark.", "I'm not a gamer but I play Clash Royale and the game works smoothly. Since the phone has the latest processor I'm sure it won't be a problem even with the latest game.", "I'm loving iOS so far but I miss the bottom keys found on Android. iOS is fluid and there are no flaws in the OS which I've encountered. I've got two minor iOS updates after my purchase and love how updates are distributed globally all at the same time. One minor inconvenience I found on iOS is to download apps more than 150 MB I'm forced to connect to wifi and so far I've not found a work around it. I got adapted to gesture navigation like it was something I've been using for ages.", "Face ID is an absolute joy to have as I don't have to do anything to unlock my phone, I just hold my phone and the phone is unlocked. And did I mention that Face ID works even in the dark? The lack of notification LED is not a big inconvenience as the screen lights up to show the notification every time I hold up my phone.", "Regarding the huge criticism it got for the low screen resolution, I don't see any problem as I hardly stream YouTube in 4K. I can view YouTube videos in 1080p without a problem which I feel is good enough as service providers in India never give enough data speed to stream videos in 4K. Regarding the screen in direct sunlight, there's no problem as the screen is clearly visible even under direct sunlight.", "The speakers on this one are a huge plus point over other devices as the speakers give a 3D surround sound like system. I love the speakers on this phone. Regarding the lack of 3.5 mm headphone jack, I see no problem as the phone is bundled with an earphone which connects to the phone.", "And yeah If you're wondering how Siri is, let me tell you that google assistant is a much better one. I've installed google assistant and I use google assistant more than Siri as google assistant is more practical. If I were to rate google assistant and Siri on a scale, 10 being the best then I would rate Siri at 5 and google assistant at 9.", "Overall I'm extremely happy with my purchase as I got it at 58,500 rupees for the 64 GB version. If anyone wants to give iOS a try then I highly recommend iPhone XR as it is the latest devices from Apple at a reasonable price. The one thing that pushed me into iOS is that Apple gives OS update for 6 years and there is no delay in OS updates. On Android, it is a pain waiting for the manufacturer to release the update after Google outs the update.  I hope my simple review of iPhone XR helped you. Thank you for reading. Cheers.", "It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and I\u2019m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase."], "instock": true, "images": [{"url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519KIlHA2wL._SL1024_.jpg", "path": "full/8f2e60bdac58c4d985743931454ee900fd485d5f.jpg", "checksum": "e8002e289ed359f9f6ca7b148a5d684e"}], "price": "\u20b9\u00a049,900.00"},

After a move to a location where a Costco membership doesn't make sense, I would buy the Kirklands via Amazon.  However, recently I decided to try a less-expensive brand--and chose the Heftys.  They are the same size as the Kirklands and, IMO just as strong.  I don't overfill my bags, and I do one little trick that really helps:  I keep a large Ziploc (usually recycled after another use) magnet-clipped on the side of my refrigerator.  In this I put the sharp tops of all cans, plastic spoons because the cheap ones I use for cat food have really sharp ends, and even the screw tops from wine bottles, because they have sharp little thingies on the sides.  When the bag is full, I zip it shut and throw it in the trash.  Result:  never any leaks in my trash bags, and this has been just as true for the Heftys as it was for the Kirklands.  Finally, I noted that some reviews were negative because of fragrance.  This was a concern for me because I'm extremely sensitive to artificial fragrances, and I have an excellent sense of smell.  However, I decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did.  When fluffing out my first bag to put into the trash bin, I thought, \"is that a fragrance?\"  I actually had to stick my nose into the bag to confirm that it was.  However, it's so light, so subtle that it doesn't bother me one whit: I never notice the fragrance when I'm putting things into the bag many times daily.  By the time I remove a bag , the fragrance has completely dissipated.  So I'm very happy with these bags and their value via Amazon Prime.", "Our usual brand.  Always consistent.  Strong and good size.", "Don't forget to use the Smile.Amazon.com address - It's an Amazon program where many things you buy every day will generate a small donation to the charity of your choice.  Read about it here:  https://smile.amazon.com/gp/chpf/about/ref=smi_se_rspo_laas_aas", "I use these heavier bags in a kitchen-size trash can because the kitchen-size bags kept ripping. I was continually having to put the ripped bags in another bag before putting these bags in my large garbage cans. Bigger than I want, but less mess and fewer bags used in the long run.", "This review is for people like me who do not tolerate artificial fragrances: The box says that it \"May contain a light scent.\"", "My boxes and the bags in them did indeed contain a light scent. To me it was a sickly sweet fragrance. I opened the boxes and put the contents outside to off-gas. I going stored them outside on the carport, but the scent did not go away even after several days. I do like the strength of the bags, but I will be looking for another brand which is truly unscented for my next purchase.", "You wouldn't think there'd be much of a difference in these various bags but there is.  These are better than the others in several ways.  They are study and don't get holes nearly as much as the Glad 'Strong' bags, plus they are far easier to open.  The tie method at the top is way easier to manage than tying  bag tabs alone, plus if you want to add something after tying you can untie and retie easily.  One product with a tie doesn't have a study enough track for the tie and it comes out far too easily so it's worthless to close the bag, where these  are more reliable.  I like them a lot better than the bags that supposedly stretch and have a weird texture.  I haven't found those very sturdy and they are harder to handle.  Gathering and taking out the trash is a pain at the best of times, but these make it a little less annoying. Even my trash man has said he likes these better than other types.", "I generate a lot of waste at the workshop (1-2 of these garbage bags on a work day), and some of it can be heavy. If you exceed about 30 pounds, the drawstrings will definitely break if you lift the bag by the strings. This means you will carry a lot of bags with a hand on the bottom of the bag if you're not careful.", "Good value.  Hold a great deal of heavy garbage.  However do not fill it past half the bag.", "Hefty are my go to trash bags. I like the 30 gal size for my kitchen trash can. They fit and fill the whole can alot better than \"tall kitchen bags\". The hefty bags are very strong and have a good pull tie. I have not had any problems with the bag splitting when full.

There's nothing worse than carrying your trash to the main garbage receptacle and having the bag rupture, leaving food all over your floor. With these bags, the 1.1 Mil. is quite strong and virtually guarantees that you'll never encounter such a problem. As an added bonus, these bags come with a drawstring, making it much easier to handle the trash.", "The bottom line is that these are a great deal on Amazon and are a great product to boot.", "I got this from Amazon because the average supermarket often does not carry bags above 13 galleons. This style as one big advantage, and one disadvantage, hence the lost star.", "Aside from the large size, the main virtue of the product is its drawstring.  Almost all 13 galleon bags have some built-in method for closing the top. Most larger bags do not, depending on plastic or wire ties. I find gathering the top of a BIG bag of sticky, pokey stuff to be not very easy, so the built-in draw string is a great feature.", "The downside is that that they are just at the thickness suitable for outside work. There are other large bags which are .85 mil. I would never get these. At 1.1 mil, these are almost thick enough for all outside jobs. They would not hold up if you are putting in refuse with pointy ends.", "But, for leaves and grass, these are probably the best, and will hold up under being filled to the brim with soft organic material.", "So it's hard to rate trash bags.  Best case scenario, they hold your trash and the sides and the pull strings don't rip.  Luckily, these trash bags are the best case scenario.  I suppose I should only give it 4 stars in case a future trash bag with the same performance and some fancy LED blinky lights comes out, but I think I'm fairly safe in just giving these 5 stars.  We've purchased these many, many times, and they are our house large trash bag.  We use them to hold lawn trash, and we also double bag all of our trash.  This bag serves as a great second bag to make sure no flies, etc., get into the first trash bag.", "I'm disappointed with these and will go back to the Kirkland brand next time.  They aren't strong in the sense that I need.  When you fill them and try to lift them out of a bin they stretch and tear and woe betide you if you put anything pointed or sharp from the garden in them.", "The bag size and strength are just perfect for my outdoor yard needs and indoor trash. I ordered these in August and am trying to work my way through the box to find some brand that is scent free. The odor from these just nauseates me and it's especially bad when working outside; raking, pruning, etc. with that horrid sweet artificial fragrance. I will not reorder these. Indeed, I have to store them out in the garage so the smell doesn't invade my closet.", "I find these bags to be stronger than any of the \"flex\" variations of bags out there. Simply put, using a bag that's large enough to accommodate the trash you're putting in there is a far simpler solution than trying to cram 12 gallons of stupid into a 10 gallon hat, as the expression goes. I'll use these in any can 10-30 gallons. Tie it when you're done, and you're done. That's it.", "the ties are not threaded through like they should be if their all like this i wouldn't even give them a one star would have sent them back but needed them can only fill have full in order to be able to tie them first time I've bot from amazon and got riped off very disappointed with product", "We have been purchasing these for a few years now and at first they were great. We had no issues with them at all up until the past 2 boxes we have purchased.  When trying to pull the bags out they seem to be melted together so you have to pull them apart.

However, they do not have easily tie-able ends.  I've had to use a stapler for this.  You have to push down and strain to get these to tie...  If they were a bit wider and if they had extended ends for tieing, this would be a winner.  As they are now, you can only fill 3/4 of the way full, because you need the last 1/4 to leave space to tie...", "I got these bags to use for our large plastic trash cans at my gallery and they work great. The regular black trash bags weren't big enough for the opening of the cans. These are really thick and don't tear when they are full of cans and bottles.

So far, we haven't had one tear on us yet, and we often fill them with heavy stuff, sharp stuff, messy stuff. If you need a tough bag, these work great.", "I bought these bags to hold bulky and miscellaneous items that would not fit in cardboard boxes, when moving to a new home, but I also found they are great for wrapping around furniture and appliances with tape, to protect them from being scratched or getting dirty. I ordered enough to use for this move plus my next move. They also are a good alternative to cardboard boxes for storing clothes and bedding, because if tied properly or taped closed, they will keep out dust and moisture, and prevent mildew and moth damage. Because the bags are made of a thicker plastic than ordinary flimsy trash bags, they hold up much better.", "Unimpressed!  The provided ties were so small they didn\u2019t even fit around closed bag!  They were thinner and more fragile then other contract bags I have purchased!  I would have returned but in the middle of the project and didn\u2019t want to run to HD or Lowes.  Ended up using 2 almost every time.  My standard garbage bags though not as thick worked just as well.  I do not recommend this product.", "I live in a house with 2 other people. We are really messy people. But, with that said, these trash bags are awesome pawsome! They're extremely tough, no matter how much junk we throw in it. I mean, we could fill it with all kinds of heavy trash/garbage and it still won't rip. If you're definitely looking for a reliable trash bag, whether for personal or business, buy these. They get an A+ from me!", "I spent a lot of time comparing price/MIL/gallon size. The price was right for 50, so I bought these. Assumed they were what the photo showed -- self-tying. They just arrived and seem as heavy-weight as the ones I'd just used up. But very disappointed they are not self-tying, as the photo implies. Had to scroll waaay down on the page just now to see they have twist-ties. And they are just cheap white standard ties in a strip -- longer than bread ties, but no stronger/wider. Can't imagine they would keep a heavy bag closed well. They need to fix the photo and put this info up front. Will take years to use up, but prefer I'd have 50 self-tying ones! I might try cutting some of them to create the self-ties. Wish I still had one of my old ones, for a pattern.", "UPDATE-  OK -- I see in the top description they say \"with ties\" but I didn't pay attention to that because I saw the picture - and assumed it was \"built-in ties\".

Lets begin with the weight.  The Amazon box was ripped when I found it on my porch. why?  Because this little box of garbage bags weighs 15 pounds.  when you have two boxes of these in a brown box and life it, you'll think there are dumbells in the box. That is professional quality right there.", "Next, each bag is folded.  I love this.  When I buy a box of 100 bags in the store, you know what you get.  Two rolls of 50 bags.  That works great for some people, but for me I like the ability to store garbage bags in multiple places.  Before. i would have to unroll a couple and try to fold them into neat little squares.  This was a major pain, as it wasted time.", "These bags let me grab as many as I need and go.  This also lets me look in the box and see how many bags I really have left.  When I have rolls of bags, I always think I have more than I actually do. So garbage day comes and while I think I have six bags left in the roll, I only have three.  That is always a bummer.", "Major brands have neat features like stretchable bags that won't tear, and make claims that their new bags use 50% less material but are 30% stronger.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out these are cost saving measures that they wish they implemented years ago.  Think about it.  For the average family, garbage bags don't have to be super strong.  Garbage is garbage.  Its not bricks. People hate overloading garbage bags because they don't want to carry a heavy bag outside. The major brands could pass the savings onto you and hive you 50% more bags, but they won't.", "These bags don't have special features like flexible plastic or any of that", "nonsense.  They are called professional quality.  They are.  They will hold garbage just fine.  They probably could hold bricks.", "i know these are tough bags because they passed what I call \"Ultimate Cat Litter Challenge\".  The challenge is for one 33 gallon bag to be able to hold 40 pounds of used cat litter from three litter boxes (So  figure at least 60 pounds) from the basement, up 15 stairs in a narrow walkway, through my kitchen, hallway, and outside.  Along the way the bags may hit the wall a bit.", "The challenge occurs every Wednesday night.  About ten different brands have been tested.  The majority fail the initial test and i end up double bagging the litter or splitting it into two bags so I don't have to clean up cat feces.  The flexible bags develop tiny leaks in the corners of the bag within a minute of being held.  This results in the litter pouring out as I walk up the stairs.  The thin bags do a little better, but they seem to stretch before ripping open.  Some brands just blow apart when they are lifted. i tried a brand with super strong drawstrings and was left holding the drawstring.", "These guys are thick. They hold the litter and I was so impressed and confident about these bags, I can actually throw the bag over my shoulder without it exploding.  If they can handle the Ultimate Cat Litter Challenge they can handle anything.", "For the price, with free shipping. These guys are super cheap.  I don't know if its because they are made from recycled  (I think used tires? Maybe that's why they are so strong?) I'm used to paying a few bucks cheaper for 50 bags.  My houses uses on average 5 bags a week.  This box of 100 will last me 20 weeks.  I have a gift card that I am using to order 50 boxes of these bad boys.  I'll never have to buy garbage bags until 2034.", "A lot of bags claim to be heavy duty but I can assure you that these are actually heavy duty. I got them to use at my work which is a machine shop. We use them through out the shop for all kinds of trash. We've been using these for a while and no one has managed to rip one yet. That is a huge deal for us. I work with a bunch of guys who think when a trash can is full you just need to compact whats in it to make room instead of changing the bag. With that being said I will be buying these for a long time as long as the quality stays amazing.", "Bought these for my business and my employee pointed out that they're all splitting down the side before she can get them out of the can and too the dump.", "Back to search for something better....", "These trash bags are huge, sturdy-- just about perfect.  They aren't particularly stretchy, which I think is a plus because it makes them less prone to ripping.  We use for regular trash (we have a huge indoor trash can) and we haven't had a single one rip or puncture.  Have bought several times now.  Only objection I have is that on last batch, box slightly redesigned.  It used to open in the middle of the top (kind of like a tissue box) but now you have to open the box flaps.  I prefer just reaching in and grabbing a bag to opening the flaps on the box.  The bags themselves, though, remain our favorites.", "My favorite garbage bags! They fit in my custom designed roll-out garbage-biin drawer, unlike the standard size bags, which are too small. They're very tough bags, with excellent poke-through resistance. I load them up, sometimes with 25-30 pounds of kitchen/household trash, including broken jars, old misshapen wire hangers, sharp-edged un-recycleable plastic containers, and all sorts of things that would rip holes in lesser garbage bags. The bag holds it all together as I drag it out of the wooden garbage drawer, empty various other waste baskets into it, haul it out to the garbage cart, and heave it in. That's more than I can say for the grocery-store bags, which tear at half the load of these bags. So load 'em up, these aren't milquetoast garbage bags.", "Where I live, it became impossible to find trash bags with twist ties years ago. Flaps, drawstrings, whatever, but no twist ties. But twist ties give you way more flexibility. You can tie off a small heavy load, still open the bag easily to add one last item, and if you're careful you can fill it waaay up and still tie it off securely (and it will stay tied off until it lands in the garbage truck!)", "Plus these bags are strong. They are a heavy weight plastic, not too stretchy, with secure bottom seams. AND you get them in boxes of 100. What's not to love?", "Added on edit: can't believe I forgot this part. These bags are pre-cut. And folded. So you don't have to juggle a large roll, try to find the perforation, try to get the bag to separate at the perforation, and so on. You just... pick one up. That's it! Like I said, what's not to love?", "Five stars. Definitely.", "These are NOT wimpy trash bags. They are large, they are heavy duty, and they are opaque. They are perfect if you are the sort of person that lets trash accumulate then discards it all at once.", "A box weighs in at 13 pounds and contains 100 individually folded 33-gallon garbage bags and ties for closing them. The bags are opaque black.", "When shopping for trash bags be certain that you are getting actual trash bags and not trash liners - trash liners tend to be very thin and can be punctured by the corner of an envelope. These garbage bags are 1.4 millimeters thick  which makes them ideal for cardboard, cans, bottles, papers, and everything else your average household or business will throw in them.
